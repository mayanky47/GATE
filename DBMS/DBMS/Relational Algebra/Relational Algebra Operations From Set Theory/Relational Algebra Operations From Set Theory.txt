*********************
Union operation (υ)
*********************
--------------------------------------------------------
It includes all tuples that are in tables A or in B.

It also eliminates duplicate tuples.

So set A UNION set B would be expressed as:
	
	A ∪ B

For a union operation to be valid, the following conditions must hold -
	R and S must be the same number of attributes.
	Attribute domains need to be compatible.
	Duplicate tuples should be automatically removed.

--------------------------------------------------------

********************
Set Difference(-)
********************
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The result of A - B, is a relation which includes all tuples that are in A but not in B.

	The attribute name of A has to match with the attribute name in B.
	The two-operand relations A and B should be either compatible or Union compatible.
	it should be defined relation consisting of the tuples that are in relation A, but in B.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
****************
Intersection (∩)
****************
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A ∩ B Defines a relation consisting of a set of all tuples that are in both A and B. However, A and B must be union-compatible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*********************
Cartesian Product(X)
*********************
------------------------------------------------
it is uesd to merge columns from two relations.

Generally, a cartesian product is never a meaningful operation when it perform alone. 
However, it becomes meaningful when it is followed by other operations. 

It is called Cross product or Cross join.
