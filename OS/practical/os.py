# A process a program in execution

#let assume I have some program like

def sum(a,b):
	return a+b
def multiply(a,b):
	return a*b
def subtract(a,b):
	return a-b

#So now how to run these program

# First we need them in memory

	#To do that we need a schedular
	#A queue in memory to keep those program
